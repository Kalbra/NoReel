You get constent that you are not subscribed to in your home feed? Not if you active Followed feed. 
Then you will only be shown content that is really useful to you. The content of your followers, your friends!
You'll see how quickly you can bring yourself up to date without random content

### Explore feed deactivation
The explore feed is similar to the reel feed: addictive. so why not deactivate it? You will have more time to spend of meaningful things.

### Story strips deactivation
You don't want to spend hours swiping through stories. Then this is your feature! When deactivating the story strip you will no longer see stories at you home screen.
But you are able to see stories via the profile if you really want to see THAT story.

### Home feed deactivation
You have enough of scrolling through the home feed and don't want to use the Followed feed as well? Then you can deactivate the home feed completely.
This feature is not related to Story strips, so if you want to see only stories you can.
